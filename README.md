# Bela Sopa
Personal Assistant in soup confection

# Description
_Bela Sopa_ consists of a Web application and a personal assistant that aims to accompany the user throughout the process of confectioning a soup recipe, targeting the adult age group and not targeting minors. During the recipe confection, the assistant is able to interact with the user, designating which ingredients are required and the steps to be performed, also providing information on the utensils and techniques to be used during the production of the dish, thus being able to respond to alternative scenarios.

# Requirements

* The web server must be running on a machine with _Windows_ operating system
* It's required to have an _Microsoft SQL Server_ instance running;
* Indicate that instance in file "3 - Construção\App\BelaSopa\appsettings.json", in the attribute "server". For example, I have the "SQLEXPRESS01" instance running.

# Running
To run the application, just run the file "BelaSopa.exe". If the DataBase doesn't exists, it is created and populated.
Since the developers didn't hava a server, the application will run in the _localhost_.
